Concatenating Strings is adding strings to make one big one variable3 = variable1 + variable 2

Indexing is done by taking variable and choosing variale number to print just a single digit or letter. print ( variable[0] )

Slicing is like indexing but a portion of a variable. print (variable[1:4])



To get A decimal number you use float variableHere = float(input("Question for getting Number")
To get just a number or interger you use int instead of float

To print a float or int you must put str(variable)
