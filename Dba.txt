To encode into ASCII, you use the chr() (short for "character") function.

To decode, you use the ord() (short for "ordinal") function.

Let's look at how it works:

def main():
    print( chr(65) )
    print( ord('A') )
main()



To convert to binary 
d = 7
binary = bin(d)

Print “binary is “ + binary 

Binary to decimal 

binary = 01010
d = int(binary, 2)
Print d

Convert dec to hex
d = 130
h = hex(d)
print h

convert hex to dec
h = 0x9c
d = int(h, 16)
print d
